  caveats <<~EOS
    GrokGauge is ad-hoc signed, not notarized by Apple. This cask removed the
    download quarantine flag from #{appdir}/GrokGauge.app so it opens normally.

    GrokGauge reads the login created by the Grok CLI. If you haven't already:
      grok login

    Grok Bot usage appears automatically if the Grok Bot app is installed.
